# Low level programming

## Interrupt

After a signal is caught, a program's execution is suspended, some registers are saved, and the CPU starts executing a special routine to handle the situation. f.e. signal from an external device, zero division, invalid instruction, attempt to execute a privileged instruction in a non-privileged mode.
