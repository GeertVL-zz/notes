# Feynman Technique

four steps:
1. identify the subject (the thing that it is that we try to understand)
   write down everything that we know
2. explain it to someone who'd know nothing about the topic (plain, simple terms) 
   When we speak without jargon it frees us from hifing behind the knowledge we don't have.
   Be brief.
   Use diagrams.
3. identify any gaps in our knowledge. (where the actual learning happens).
4. organize & simplify into a narrative
   use simple sentences to explain something
   analogies to explain something
   tests our understanding, challenges our assumptions.
   you dont know what you dont know.
   I'm smart enough to know that I'm dumb
   reinforcing what we do know
    

You must not be afraid of your uniqueness and you must care less and less what people think of you. 
You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish. 
I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be.
